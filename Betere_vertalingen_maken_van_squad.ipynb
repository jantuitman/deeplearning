The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.\"\n",

The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions. The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine. The territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of Rouen, and reproduced the Roman administrative structure of Gallia Lugdunensis II (part of the former Gallia Lugdunensis).\"\n",

Having obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania, capturing Valona, Kanina, Jericho (Orikumi), and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the command to a high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium. The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy. They lost Dyrrachium, Valona, and Butrint in 1085, after the death of Robert.\"\n",

This time, the Albanians sided with the Normans, dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them. With their help, the Normans secured the Arbanon passes and opened their way to Dibra.

Initially the Normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity. Yet, with time, they came to be subsumed into Irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became \\\"more Irish than the Irish themselves.\\\" The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of Ireland, later known as the Pale, and also built many fine castles and settlements, including Trim Castle and Dublin Castle. Both cultures intermixed, borrowing from each other's language, culture and outlook. Norman descendants today can be recognised by their surnames. Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County Wexford where the first Norman settlements were established. Other Norman names such as Furlong predominate there. Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell) derived from the French Norman name Morel. Other names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) indicate Norman ancestry. These included Fitzgerald, FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, Fitzmaurice. Other families bearing such surnames as Barry (de Barra) and De B\\u00farca (Burke) are also of Norman extraction.\"\n",

Having spent time at the court of Henry I of England (married to David's sister Maud of Scotland), and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half-brother M\\u00e1el Coluim mac Alaxandair, David had to reward many with lands. The process was continued under David's successors, most intensely of all under William the Lion. The Norman-derived feudal system was applied in varying degrees to most of Scotland. Scottish families of the names Bruce, Gray, Ramsay, Fraser, Ogilvie, Montgomery, Sinclair, Pollock, Burnard, Douglas and Gordon to name but a few, and including the later royal House of Stewart, can all be traced back to Norman ancestry.\"\n",

However, in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform, encouraging the Cluniac reform of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits, especially the proliferation of scriptoria and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost illuminated manuscripts. The church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy. The chief monasteries taking part in this \\\"renaissance\\\" of Norman art and scholarship were Mont-Saint-Michel, F\\u00e9camp, Jumi\\u00e8ges, Bec, Saint-Ouen, Saint-Evroul, and Saint-Wandrille. These centres were in contact with the so-called \\\"Winchester school\\\", which channeled a pure Carolingian artistic tradition to Normandy. In the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century, Normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts, but it was brief and the major scriptoria of Normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century.\"\n",

In southern Italy, however, Norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its Greek, Lombard, and Arab forebears. Of the royal regalia preserved in Palermo, the crown is Byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of Arab craftsmanship with Arabic inscriptions. Many churches preserve sculptured fonts, capitals, and more importantly mosaics, which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage. Lombard Salerno was a centre of ivorywork in the 11th century and this continued under Norman domination. Finally should be noted the intercourse between French Crusaders traveling to the Holy Land who brought with them French artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern Italy amongst their Norman cousins. For this reason many south Italian churches preserve works from France alongside their native pieces.\"\n",

            "      <context>The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East. The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.</context>\n",

The Duchy of Normandy, which began in 911 as a fiefdom, was established by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and the famed Viking ruler Rollo, and was situated in the former Frankish kingdom of Neustria. The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions. The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine. The territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of Rouen, and reproduced the Roman administrative structure of Gallia Lugdunensis II (part of the former Gallia Lugdunensis).</context>\n",

            "      <context>Robert Guiscard, an other Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of Apulia as the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern Italy. Having obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania, capturing Valona, Kanina, Jericho (Orikumi), and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the command to a high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium. The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy. They lost Dyrrachium, Valona, and Butrint in 1085, after the death of Robert.</context>\n",

Meanwhile, they occupied Petrela, the citadel of Mili at the banks of the river Deabolis, Gllavenica (Ballsh), Kanina and Jericho. This time, the Albanians sided with the Normans, dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them. With their help, the Normans secured the Arbanon passes and opened their way to Dibra.

Not only were their original Viking brethren still ravaging the English coasts, they occupied most of the important ports opposite England across the English Channel. This relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of Emma, sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy, and King Ethelred II of England. Because of this, Ethelred fled to Normandy in 1013, when he was forced from his kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard. His stay in Normandy (until 1016) influenced him and his sons by Emma, who stayed in Normandy after Cnut the Great's conquest of the isle.</context>\n",

He appointed Robert of Jumièges archbishop of Canterbury and made Ralph the Timid earl of Hereford.

            "      <context>The Normans had a profound effect on Irish culture and history after their invasion at Bannow Bay in 1169. Initially the Normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity. Yet, with time, they came to be subsumed into Irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became &quot;more Irish than the Irish themselves.&quot; The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of Ireland, later known as the Pale, and also built many fine castles and settlements, including Trim Castle and Dublin Castle. Both cultures intermixed, borrowing from each other's language, culture and outlook. Norman descendants today can be recognised by their surnames. Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County Wexford where the first Norman settlements were established. Other Norman names such as Furlong predominate there. Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell) derived from the French Norman name Morel. Other names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) indicate Norman ancestry. These included Fitzgerald, FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, Fitzmaurice. Other families bearing such surnames as Barry (de Barra) and De Búrca (Burke) are also of Norman extraction.</context>\n",

King David I of Scotland, whose elder brother Alexander I had married Sybilla of Normandy, was instrumental in introducing Normans and Norman culture to Scotland, part of the process some scholars call the &quot;Davidian Revolution&quot;. Having spent time at the court of Henry I of England (married to David's sister Maud of Scotland), and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half-brother Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair, David had to reward many with lands. The process was continued under David's successors, most intensely of all under William the Lion. The Norman-derived feudal system was applied in varying degrees to most of Scotland. Scottish families of the names Bruce, Gray, Ramsay, Fraser, Ogilvie, Montgomery, Sinclair, Pollock, Burnard, Douglas and Gordon to name but a few, and including the later royal House of Stewart, can all be traced back to Norman ancestry.</context>\n",

All declared their support for Richard provided that he support Guy against his rival Conrad of Montferrat. The local barons abandoned Isaac, who considered making peace with Richard, joining him on the crusade, and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by Richard. But Isaac changed his mind and tried to escape. Richard then proceeded to conquer the whole island, his troops being led by Guy de Lusignan. Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains, because Richard had promised that he would not place him in irons. By 1 June, Richard had conquered the whole island. His exploit was well publicized and contributed to his reputation; he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island. Richard left for Acre on 5 June, with his allies. Before his departure, he named two of his Norman generals, Richard de Camville and Robert de Thornham, as governors of Cyprus.</context>\n",

However, in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform, encouraging the Cluniac reform of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits, especially the proliferation of scriptoria and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost illuminated manuscripts. The church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy. The chief monasteries taking part in this &quot;renaissance&quot; of Norman art and scholarship were Mont-Saint-Michel, Fécamp, Jumièges, Bec, Saint-Ouen, Saint-Evroul, and Saint-Wandrille. These centres were in contact with the so-called &quot;Winchester school&quot;, which channeled a pure Carolingian artistic tradition to Normandy. In the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century, Normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts, but it was brief and the major scriptoria of Normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century.</context>\n",

In southern Italy, however, Norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its Greek, Lombard, and Arab forebears. Of the royal regalia preserved in Palermo, the crown is Byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of Arab craftsmanship with Arabic inscriptions. Many churches preserve sculptured fonts, capitals, and more importantly mosaics, which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage. Lombard Salerno was a centre of ivorywork in the 11th century and this continued under Norman domination. Finally should be noted the intercourse between French Crusaders traveling to the Holy Land who brought with them French artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern Italy amongst their Norman cousins. For this reason many south Italian churches preserve works from France alongside their native pieces.</context>\n",

Fécamp Abbey and Saint-Evroul Abbey were centres of musical production and education. At Fécamp, under two Italian abbots, William of Volpiano and John of Ravenna, the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught. It is still the most common form of pitch representation in English- and German-speaking countries today. Also at Fécamp, the staff, around which neumes were oriented, was first developed and taught in the 11th century. Under the German abbot Isembard, La Trinité-du-Mont became a centre of musical composition.</context>\n",

De aparte culturele en etnische identiteit van de Normandiërs ontstond aanvankelijk in de eerste helft van de 10e eeuw en bleef zich in de daaropvolgende eeuwen ontwikkelen.</translated_context>\n",

            "      <context>The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East. The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.</context>\n",

De Normandiërs werden beroemd om hun krijgshaftigheid en uiteindelijk om hun christelijke vroomheid, en werden exponenten van de katholieke orthodoxie waarin zij zich integreerden. Zij namen de Gallo-Romaanse taal over van het Frankische land waar zij zich vestigden, en hun dialect werd bekend als Normandisch, Normaund of Normandisch Frans, een belangrijke literaire taal. Het hertogdom Normandië, dat zij bij verdrag met de Franse kroon vormden, was een groot leengoed van het middeleeuwse Frankrijk, en werd onder Richard I van Normandië tot een samenhangend en geducht vorstendom in feodale dienst gesmeed. De Normandiërs staan bekend om hun cultuur, zoals hun unieke Romaanse architectuur en muzikale tradities, en om hun belangrijke militaire prestaties en innovaties. Normandische avonturiers stichtten het koninkrijk Sicilië onder Roger II, nadat zij Zuid-Italië hadden veroverd op de Saracenen en de Byzantijnen, en een expeditie namens hun hertog, Willem de Veroveraar, leidde tot de Normandische verovering van Engeland in de Slag bij Hastings in 1066. Vanuit deze nieuwe Europese centra verspreidde de Normandische culturele en militaire invloed zich naar de kruisvaardersstaten in het Nabije Oosten, waar hun prins Bohemond I het vorstendom Antiochië in de Levant stichtte, naar Schotland en Wales in Groot-Brittannië, naar Ierland en naar de kusten van Noord-Afrika en de Canarische Eilanden.</translated_context>\n",

            "      <context>In the course of the 10th century, the initially destructive incursions of Norse war bands into the rivers of France evolved into more permanent encampments that included local women and personal property. The Duchy of Normandy, which began in 911 as a fiefdom, was established by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and the famed Viking ruler Rollo, and was situated in the former Frankish kingdom of Neustria. The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions. The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine. The territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of Rouen, and reproduced the Roman administrative structure of Gallia Lugdunensis II (part of the former Gallia Lugdunensis).</context>\n",

Het hertogdom Normandië, dat in 911 begon als een leengoed, werd opgericht bij het verdrag van Saint-Clair-sur-Epte tussen koning Karel III van West-Frankrijk en de beroemde Vikingheerser Rollo, en lag in het voormalige Frankische koninkrijk Neustrië. Het verdrag bood Rollo en zijn mannen de Franse gebieden tussen de rivier de Epte en de Atlantische kust in ruil voor hun bescherming tegen verdere invallen van de Vikingen. Het gebied kwam overeen met het noordelijke deel van het huidige Opper-Normandië tot aan de rivier de Seine, maar het hertogdom zou zich uiteindelijk tot voorbij de Seine naar het westen uitstrekken. Het gebied kwam ongeveer overeen met de oude provincie Rouen en nam de Romeinse bestuursstructuur van Gallia Lugdunensis II (een deel van de vroegere Gallia Lugdunensis) over.</translated_context>\n",

Later, many took up service with the Armenian state further south in Cilicia and the Taurus Mountains. A Norman named Oursel led a force of &quot;Franks&quot; into the upper Euphrates valley in northern Syria. From 1073 to 1074, 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian general Philaretus Brachamius were Normans—formerly of Oursel—led by Raimbaud. They even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle: Afranji, meaning &quot;Franks.&quot; The known trade between Amalfi and Antioch and between Bari and Tarsus may be related to the presence of Italo-Normans in those cities while Amalfi and Bari were under Norman rule in Italy.</context>\n",

Zij leenden hun etniciteit zelfs aan de naam van hun kasteel: De bekende handel tussen Amalfi en Antiochië en tussen Bari en Tarsus kan verband houden met de aanwezigheid van Italo-Normandiërs in die steden, terwijl Amalfi en Bari onder Normandisch bewind stonden in Italië.</translated_context>\n",

            "      <context>Robert Guiscard, an other Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of Apulia as the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern Italy. Having obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania, capturing Valona, Kanina, Jericho (Orikumi), and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the command to a high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium. The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy. They lost Dyrrachium, Valona, and Butrint in 1085, after the death of Robert.</context>\n",
            "      <translated_context language=\"nl\">Robert Guiscard, een andere Normandische avonturier die door zijn militaire successen tot graaf van Apulië was verheven, verdreef uiteindelijk de Byzantijnen uit Zuid-Italië. Met toestemming van paus Gregorius VII en als zijn vazal zette Robert zijn campagne voort om het Balkanschiereiland te veroveren als steunpunt voor westerse leenheren en de katholieke kerk. Nadat hij zich verbonden had met Kroatië en de katholieke steden in Dalmatië, leidde hij in 1081 een leger van 30.000 man in 300 schepen die op de zuidelijke kusten van Albanië landden en Valona, Kanina, Jericho (Orikumi) veroverden en na talrijke plunderingen Butrint bereikten. Ze voegden zich bij de vloot die eerder Korfoe had veroverd en vielen Dyrrachium aan vanaf het land en de zee, waarbij ze alles onderweg verwoestten. Onder deze barre omstandigheden accepteerde de lokale bevolking de oproep van keizer Alexius I Comnenus om zich met de Byzantijnen te verenigen tegen de Noormannen. De Albanese troepen konden niet deelnemen aan de daaropvolgende strijd omdat die al voor hun aankomst was begonnen. Vlak voor de slag had de Venetiaanse vloot een overwinning behaald op de kust rond de stad. Gedwongen om zich terug te trekken, stond Alexius het commando af aan een hoge Albanese ambtenaar, Comiscortes genaamd, in dienst van Byzantium. Het garnizoen van de stad verzette zich tot februari 1082, toen Dyrrachium door de Venetiaanse en Amalfitaanse kooplieden die zich er hadden gevestigd aan de Noormannen werd verraden. De Noormannen waren nu vrij om door te dringen in het achterland; ze namen Ioannina en enkele kleinere steden in het zuidwesten van Macedonië en Thessalië in, voordat ze aan de poorten van Thessaloniki verschenen. Tweedracht onder de hoge rangen dwong de Noormannen zich terug te trekken naar Italië. Ze verloren Dyrrachium, Valona en Butrint in 1085, na de dood van Robert.</translated_context>\n",

This time, the Albanians sided with the Normans, dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them.

            "      <context>The Normans were in contact with England from an early date. Not only were their original Viking brethren still ravaging the English coasts, they occupied most of the important ports opposite England across the English Channel. This relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of Emma, sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy, and King Ethelred II of England. Because of this, Ethelred fled to Normandy in 1013, when he was forced from his kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard. His stay in Normandy (until 1016) influenced him and his sons by Emma, who stayed in Normandy after Cnut the Great's conquest of the isle.</context>\n",

Niet alleen teisterden hun oorspronkelijke Vikingbroeders nog steeds de Engelse kusten, zij bezetten ook de meeste belangrijke havens tegenover Engeland aan de overkant van het Kanaal. Deze relatie leidde uiteindelijk tot nauwere bloedbanden door het huwelijk van Emma, zuster van hertog Richard II van Normandië, en koning Ethelred II van Engeland. Hierdoor vluchtte Ethelred in 1013 naar Normandië, toen hij door Sweyn Forkbeard uit zijn koninkrijk werd verdreven. Zijn verblijf in Normandië (tot 1016) beïnvloedde hem en zijn zonen door Emma, die in Normandië bleef na de verovering van het eiland door Cnut de Grote.</translated_context>\n",

He also brought many Norman counsellors and fighters, some of whom established an English cavalry force. This concept never really took root, but it is a typical example of the attitudes of Edward. He appointed Robert of Jumièges archbishop of Canterbury and made Ralph the Timid earl of Hereford.

Both cultures intermixed, borrowing from each other's language, culture and outlook. Norman descendants today can be recognised by their surnames. Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County Wexford where the first Norman settlements were established. Other Norman names such as Furlong predominate there. Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell) derived from the French Norman name Morel. Other names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) indicate Norman ancestry. These included Fitzgerald, FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, Fitzmaurice. Other families bearing such surnames as Barry (de Barra) and De Búrca (Burke) are also of Norman extraction.</context>\n",

Aanvankelijk behielden de Noormannen een aparte cultuur en etniciteit. Mettertijd gingen ze echter op in de Ierse cultuur, tot het punt waarop gezegd is dat ze &quot;Ierser werden dan de Ieren zelf&quot;. De Noormannen vestigden zich vooral in een gebied in het oosten van Ierland, dat later bekend werd als de Pale, en bouwden ook veel mooie kastelen en nederzettingen, waaronder Trim Castle en Dublin Castle. Beide culturen vermengden zich en leenden van elkaars taal, cultuur en opvattingen. Normandische afstammelingen zijn tegenwoordig te herkennen aan hun achternamen. Namen als French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy en Lacy komen vooral voor in het zuidoosten van Ierland, met name in het zuidelijke deel van County Wexford, waar de eerste Normandische nederzettingen werden gesticht. Andere Normandische namen zoals Furlong overheersen daar. Een andere veel voorkomende Normandisch-Ierse naam was Morell (Murrell), afgeleid van de Franse Normandische naam Morel.

William invaded Scotland in 1072, riding as far as Abernethy where he met up with his fleet of ships.

            "      <context>Normans came into Scotland, building castles and founding noble families who would provide some future kings, such as Robert the Bruce, as well as founding a considerable number of the Scottish clans. King David I of Scotland, whose elder brother Alexander I had married Sybilla of Normandy, was instrumental in introducing Normans and Norman culture to Scotland, part of the process some scholars call the &quot;Davidian Revolution&quot;. Having spent time at the court of Henry I of England (married to David's sister Maud of Scotland), and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half-brother Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair, David had to reward many with lands. The process was continued under David's successors, most intensely of all under William the Lion. The Norman-derived feudal system was applied in varying degrees to most of Scotland. Scottish families of the names Bruce, Gray, Ramsay, Fraser, Ogilvie, Montgomery, Sinclair, Pollock, Burnard, Douglas and Gordon to name but a few, and including the later royal House of Stewart, can all be traced back to Norman ancestry.</context>\n",

Omdat hij aan het hof van Hendrik I van Engeland (getrouwd met Davids zuster Maud van Schotland) had doorgebracht en hen nodig had om het koninkrijk van zijn halfbroer Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair af te pakken, moest David velen belonen met landerijen. Dit proces werd voortgezet onder Davids opvolgers, vooral onder Willem de Leeuw. Het van Normandiërs afgeleide feodale systeem werd in verschillende mate toegepast op het grootste deel van Schotland. Schotse families met de namen Bruce, Gray, Ramsay, Fraser, Ogilvie, Montgomery, Sinclair, Pollock, Burnard, Douglas en Gordon, om er maar een paar te noemen, en met inbegrip van het latere koninklijke huis Stewart, zijn allemaal terug te voeren op Normandische voorouders.</translated_context>\n",

            "      <context>In the visual arts, the Normans did not have the rich and distinctive traditions of the cultures they conquered. However, in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform, encouraging the Cluniac reform of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits, especially the proliferation of scriptoria and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost illuminated manuscripts. The church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy. The chief monasteries taking part in this &quot;renaissance&quot; of Norman art and scholarship were Mont-Saint-Michel, Fécamp, Jumièges, Bec, Saint-Ouen, Saint-Evroul, and Saint-Wandrille. These centres were in contact with the so-called &quot;Winchester school&quot;, which channeled a pure Carolingian artistic tradition to Normandy. In the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century, Normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts, but it was brief and the major scriptoria of Normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century.</context>\n",

In het begin van de 11e eeuw begonnen de hertogen echter met een programma van kerkelijke hervormingen, waarbij ze de Cluniac-hervorming van de kloosters aanmoedigden en intellectuele activiteiten beschermden, met name de verspreiding van scriptoria en de reconstructie van een compilatie van verloren gegane verluchte manuscripten. De kerk werd door de hertogen gebruikt als een bindende kracht voor hun ongelijksoortige hertogdom. De belangrijkste kloosters die deelnamen aan deze &quot;renaissance&quot; van de Normandische kunst en wetenschap waren Mont-Saint-Michel, Fécamp, Jumièges, Bec, Saint-Ouen, Saint-Evroul en Saint-Wandrille. Deze centra stonden in contact met de zogenaamde &quot;school van Winchester&quot;, die een zuiver Karolingische kunsttraditie naar Normandië leidde. In het laatste decennium van de 11e en het eerste decennium van de 12e eeuw beleefde Normandië een gouden eeuw van geïllustreerde handschriften, maar deze was van korte duur en de grote scriptoria van Normandië hielden op te bestaan na het midden van de eeuw.</translated_context>\n",

            "      <context>In Britain, Norman art primarily survives as stonework or metalwork, such as capitals and baptismal fonts. In southern Italy, however, Norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its Greek, Lombard, and Arab forebears. Of the royal regalia preserved in Palermo, the crown is Byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of Arab craftsmanship with Arabic inscriptions. Many churches preserve sculptured fonts, capitals, and more importantly mosaics, which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage. Lombard Salerno was a centre of ivorywork in the 11th century and this continued under Norman domination. Finally should be noted the intercourse between French Crusaders traveling to the Holy Land who brought with them French artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern Italy amongst their Norman cousins. For this reason many south Italian churches preserve works from France alongside their native pieces.</context>\n",

In Zuid-Italië daarentegen is de Normandische kunst overvloedig bewaard gebleven in vormen die sterk beïnvloed zijn door hun Griekse, Lombardische en Arabische voorouders. Van de koninklijke regalia die in Palermo bewaard zijn gebleven, is de kroon Byzantijns van stijl en is de kroningsmantel van Arabisch vakmanschap met Arabische opschriften. In veel kerken zijn gebeeldhouwde doopvonten, kapitelen en vooral mozaïeken bewaard gebleven, die gebruikelijk waren in Normandisch Italië en sterk leunden op het Griekse erfgoed. Lombardisch Salerno was een centrum van ivoorbewerking in de 11e eeuw en dit bleef zo onder Normandische overheersing. Tenslotte zij gewezen op de contacten tussen Franse kruisvaarders die naar het Heilige Land reisden en Franse voorwerpen meebrachten om de kerken waar zij halt hielden in Zuid-Italië te schenken aan hun Normandische neven.

At Fécamp, under two Italian abbots, William of Volpiano and John of Ravenna, the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught. It is still the most common form of pitch representation in English- and German-speaking countries today.
